# Version Control

[Presentation](ep1000_git.pdf)

Version control is the management of changes to documents, software, web sites and other collections of information. In usual practise, the change of such documentation is done by labelling the filename or document with a number or letter code e.g. v1.01, v4a.

**[Reasons for version control](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1408450/why-should-i-use-version-control)**

Assuming you are writing an essay/paper/code for an assignment that has to be submitted online, have you ever:

- Made a change to the work, realised it was a mistake and wanted to revert back?
- Lost work or had a backup that was too old?
- Had to maintain multiple versions of the assignment ?
- Wanted to see the difference between two (or more) versions of your work?
- Wanted to prove that a particular change broke orfixed a section of your work?
- Wanted to review the history of some work, to see what you deleted? * Wanted to submit a change to someone else's work, in collaboration with yours?
- Wanted to share your work, or let other people help work on your assignment? * Wanted to see how much work is being done, and where when and by whom?
- Wanted to experiment with a new feature without interfering with the current working assignment?

If you answered **YES** to any of the above questions, then you need a *version control system*.

## git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a free and open-source distributed version control system.  It is very easy to learn and provides good support for all projects regardless of size.  It is also available for different Operating Systems (OS).

git usually works from the CLI (command-line interface), however there are GUI (Graphic User Interfaces) available, which are easier for the beginner.

A summary of the git commands are given in the table, it provides a reference of what we usually use.

Before we use git, we usually need to identify ourselves to git and to the repository

```bash
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.emal "jdoe1234@example.com"
```

You would usually log-in or provide your credentials to the remote repository so that you can access your account.

|git command         | Purpose                                         |
|:-------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| *Initialise*         | Usually done only once to start the repository  |
| git clone <repo>   | Clones/Copies and downloads a repository to your folder.<br>It is a fast way of making a copy of an existing work.  There are <br>Two methods of cloning: SSH and HTTPS.  We shall use HTTPS |
| git init           | Initialises a local folder for git |
| git pull           | Brings down a current version of the repository.<br> Works only when the repository already exists.<br> Should always be the first command, before you start any work. |
| *Repeated*           |      |
| git add *          | Add any files to the staging area.<br>This will pick up any files which have been updated/added/removeid.|
| git status         | Shows the files in staging area|
| git commit -m <br>"info on what is done" | Moves the files from the staging area to the local repo |
| git push           | Copies the files from the local pc to the remote repo |

There are other commands, however, we will leave them for now until you are fully acquinted with the git process.

The following diagram illustrates what usually happens:

## Tutorials for git

There are many tutorials for git (shows you how important git is) and we recommend that you watch at least one Youtube video and walk through one git tutorial.

### Youtube videos on git

## git for Windows 10

As most of you are working with Microsoft Windows 10, there are a number of versions of git that you can use:

- [git for windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)<br>
    install git BASH (CLI) and git GUI (GUI version).  Usually users would go fof the git BASH version in this installation as it is the closest to the Linux versions.
- [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)<br>
    which is a collaboration of git and Github.  If you are using git with the GitHub repository, then this is the solution for you.  It is the easiest to use and provides the necessary collaboration with the git commands.  We **recommend** that you use this for your repo.

    As you are using git for the first time, I would suggest using <pb>Git Desktop</pb> as it simplifies
    all the handling of the git commands in a GUI interface.

### Github Desktop

I've already written a guide here for staring a repo using Mr Steven Chew's [web-pk](https://github.com/skeatz/web-pk), you can follow the guide [here](web-pk/web-pk.md).

Quick links:

-  [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for Windows

### Assignment - git


In this assignment, you will use git (on github) to manage a repository.  To help you with git, you 
will be asked to view one of the video tutorials, however, working with the git desktop instead of 
with the CLI (command line interface).

Here is an outline of what you will need to do to complete this assessment

1.  Create an account on github
2.  Install github Desktop on your laptop.  (Mac/Linux users, please see me)
3.  Configure your github Desktop to communicate with your github account.  You may need to enter your
login and password credentials.
4.  Using the github account or github Desktop, create a repository on github, clone the repository to your laptop.
5.  Following one of the tutorials, use github desktop to manage the github account, trying out the functions of
  - adding files to the local stash
  - committing your work to the local pc
  - pushing your work to the github repository
  - retrieving your work from the github repository
  - making changes to your local work
  - recovering old files from the github repository.

One **LUCKY** person will present his/her work to the class as the next session.

## Using git

Once you are familiar with git, convert your project site to using git.  Using the following specifications
in creating your project site.

1.  The project site <pb>MUST</pb> have the name EP1000
2.  The project site must be managed using git.
3.  Convert the site to be host using github webpages.
4.  Fill in your website URL in the Google Sheet Pages as specified.

Please keep your site updated, as you will be graded on your assighments, blog and module project using
this site.

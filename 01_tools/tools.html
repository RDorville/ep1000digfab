# EP1000 Tools

[Presentation](/oops.jpg)

## Fablab SP

The FabLab@SP is a fully operational fabrication lab/workshop with manual and computer controlled (Computer Numerical Control) machines which are able to create or cut material to form the final object.

FabLab@SP is currently operating in the following locations:

- T1442 EA Fablab
- T11C FabLab Central, and
- MakerSpace@Library

Each location carries a full set of manual and powered hand-tools together with a set of 3D printers, Laser cutters and other computer cutting tools.  In each lab, you will be able to find specialised equipment suited for your needs and requirements, for example:

- T1442 EA is suited for small projects requiring microcontroller board fabrication, integration and troubleshooting.
- MakerSpace@Library is suited for hobbists and makers with a variety of small project making equipment e.g. T-shirt printing, various 3D Printing techniques, 3D scanning and photography.
- T11C is for large projects requiring specialised cutting skills, carpentry, forming and routing.

Most of the tools are available for use and training and in-house certification is provided, as the FabLab believes that you should be the one working on the practical side of the project to gain experience and know-how.  Of course, there will be staff-on-hand and trained personnel to help you along the way.

## Software Tools

More importantly, is your choice of software tools.

In most of your work, you will be using your laptop to create and design your object or product.  You will also need to document your work so that you can repeat the project, share your work and highlight your findings.

As a preference, we would like to use Open Source Tools as we are not restricted to licensed and paid software and their demands,

You will need the following <pb>(Recommended)</pb> tools:
- a text editor
  - [<pb>Visual Code Studio</pb>](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

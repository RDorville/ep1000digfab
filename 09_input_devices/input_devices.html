# Input Devices

[Presentation: Input Devices](ep1000_sensors.pdf)

Input devices are often called **Sensors**.  Output devices are often called **Actuators**.  The process of connecting a Sensor or Actuator to a computer processor system is called Interfacing.


## Sensors

- A sensor is a device, module, machine or subsystem whose purpose is to detect events or changes in its environment and send the information to other electronics, frequently a computer processor. (Ref: [Wikipedia: Sensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor))
- Used in everyday objects to read changes in the environment.
- Sensor readings are usually analog by nature.
- Changes are usually slower in availability (compared to computer processors) and require some processing techniques.


## Methods of reading sensors

There are 3 basic methods of reading/obtaining information from a sensor.  These methods are dependent upon the availability of the information, as read by the sensor
- Always available
    - Just read the data, data is always available
    - Changes to the reading occur very slowly.
    - E.g. temperature
- Polling
    - Processor has to continually query/poll the sensor for information.
    - Sensor will usually indicate whether there is new information through another signal or have a drastic change in the reading to indicate that there is a new reading available.
    - When Processor "sees" this change, data is read.
    - E.g. switch
- Triggering
    - A trigger is a signal(s) that is used to initiate the reading.
    - Sequence is as follows:
        + Processor sends a signal to the sensor for data
        + Sensor gathers information, and when ready
        + Sends reading back to the Processor.  The Sensor may also indicate that data is ready to be read by sending back an Acknowledge/Ready signal
    - E.g. Ultrasonic distance measurement


## Sensor data

Real environment data is analog by nature.  It may be some physical element e.g. temperature, distance
- A sensor converts this data into an **equivalent** electrical signal/voltage that is sent to the computer processor.
- The computer processor has to read this electrical signal and convert it into an understandable value.
- Analog signals
  - most common type of sensor data
  - requires conversion to a digital value, usually with an ADC
  - usually it is a direct relationship e.g. V = K * environment-value
- Digital signals
  - these sensors are configured as smart devices, with processing power
  - sensor itself converts the analog values into a digital signal (e.g. pulse or series of digits)
  - processor needs to decode to understand the value
- Arduino Libraries
    - The Arduino System is very popular because there is large number of libraries (of code) available for almost every Sensor that you can think of.
    - Add libraries to the Arduino IDE System (Ref: Arduino.cc [Installing Additional Arduino Libraries](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries))
      - There are two types of libraries,
        - Search able using the Arduino IDE system (Internal)
        - External libraries, available as compressed C++ code.
      - How to add a library using the Library Manager
         1.  `IDE > Sketch > Install Library > Manage Libraries`
         2.  Search for the library
         3.  Highlight and click Install, when complete, it should state "Installed"
      - How to add an External library (.ZIP format)
         1.  Search for the library on the Internet
         2.  Download the library, usually in a compressed .ZIP file
         3.  `IDE > Sketch > Include Library > Add .Zip Library`
         4.  Close the IDE. Re-open.
      - How to manually add an External Library
         1.  Search for the library on the Internet
         2.  Download the library, usually in a compressed .ZIP file
         3.  Locate where your sketch folder is found on your computer using `IDE > File > Preferences > Sketchbook`
         4.  Extract the Library from the ZIP file (this is usually a folder)
         5.  Copy the extracted library folder to [Sketchbook folder] > Libraries folder
         6.  Close the IDE.  Re-open.
    - Check that the Library has been added using `IDE > Sketch > Include Library`.  You should see your installed library there.
    - To apply the library code to your application, add the header file a the top of your sketch using `IDE > Sketch > Include Library > LibName`.  The header file has an extension of `.h`.

## Types of Sensors

### Switches

- An electrical component that can disconnect or connect the conducting path of a circuit.
- Provides a LOW or HIGH signal depending on the circuitry.
- Use `digitalRead()` to determine value of a switch.
- Be aware of debouncing techniques when mechanical switches are in use.
- Types of switches
  - [Toggle](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=toggle+switch&t=canonical&iax=images&ia=images)
      - a mechanical switch that changes the state each time the switch is thrown/manipulated.
      - e.g. If in the ON position, throwing the switch will change it to an OFF position.
      - the state remains until the switch is thrown
  - [Pushbutton switch](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=pushbutton+switch&t=canonical&iar=images&iax=images&ia=images)
      - a spring-loaded mechanical switch that changes state when the switch is pressed.  When released (and because of the spring) the switch returns to the original state.
      - Two types of pushbutton switches
          - normally closed - push to open/break connection
          - normally open - push to close/make connection
  - [Slide switch](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=slide+switch&t=canonical&iar=images&iax=images&ia=images)
      - a switch which is closed or opened by a sliding mechanism.
      - when changed, the switch remains in the new state.
  - [Touch Capacitative switch](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=touch+capacitative+switch&t=canonical&iar=images&iax=images&ia=images)
      - switch works based on body capacitance.
      - when a person touches it, the body increases the capacitance of the switch and triggers the switch

### Temperature, Humidity

- the environment can be measured using a number of devices, the most common and cheapest is to use the DHT-11 temperature and humidity sensor.
  - temperature is a physical quantity that expresses hot or cold.
  - reference temperatures
    -  freezing point of water = 0 degrees Centigrade
    -  boiling point of water = 100 degrees Centigrade
    -  typical Singapore temperature = 28 - 32 degrees Centigrade
- humidity is the measure of the concentration of water vapor present in the air.  Singapore's humidity is between 70-90%.

### Distance
- This depends on the distance to be measured.  The devices can range from a limit switch to an ultrasonic sensor.
- [Photoelectric InfraRed Avoidance detection/Proximity sensor](https://osoyoo.com/2018/12/21/arduino-lesson-ir-obstacle-avoidance-module/)
  - distance: 2cm ~ 40cm
  - can use **EN**able pulse or continuous measurement
  - avoidance distance is adjusted with potentiometer
  - does not measure distance, just detects it

&nbsp;

### Time

- These are modules that allow you to keep track of the time.  A RTC uses a small battery, crystal and memory to maintain a on-going clock which can be read to provide the current date and time.
- Real-time Clock Modules
  - [RTC DS3231 using I2C](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/MisterBotBreak/how-to-use-a-real-time-clock-module-ds3231-bc90fe)
  - [RTC DS1302 using single-wire](https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/DS1302/)

&nbsp;

### Others

- [Rotary Encoders](https://dronebotworkshop.com/rotary-encoders-arduino/)
    - a rotary encoder reads the positional value of a shaft by comparing 2 pulses as the shaft turns.
    - looks like a potentiometer, but does not change resistance
    - rotary encoders are now used for volume controls, motor encoders etc

- Weight
    - A load cell provides a means of measuring the weight of an object.  This is done by the measuring the contraction of metals.  Usually a module is provided to read the data from a load cell and transfer the results to the computer processor.
    - [Load Cell Weight Sensor HX711 AD Converter](https://www.brainy-bits.com/load-cell-and-hx711-with-arduino/)

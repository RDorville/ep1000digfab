# Module Project

[Presentation: Module Project](ep1000_moduleproject.pdf)

## Objective:

1. Demonstrate the digital fabrication skills learnt in the production
of a project.
2. Present and defend the ideas/technologies used in the construction.
3. Demonstrate integration of skills in the completion of a project.

## Task

In this module project you will demonstrate the skills and techniques that you have learnt in the module.  This is an individual project.  The  project **must** have the following components:

1. Documentation - Idea, Construction, How-do, Instruction manual
2. CADD and/or Digital graphic components (vector/raster) of design
3. 2D cutting and engraving part(s)
4. 3D printed part (s)
5. Embedded control using a micro-controller with
  - input(s)
  - output(s)

You can select your own project, however, it must meet the above requirements. You can select your project from 

- one of the suggestions below
- taken from the Internet (Instructables, Thingiverse etc), or
- of your own design

However, all design drawings (CAD, graphics) must be done by you.  If you have selected to use a design from the Internet, you need to

- attribute the original design to the author
- reproduce all design drawings
- make changes to the original design as published
- make changes to the code used for the embedded controller to suit your purpose.

We would suggest the following steps before starting on your project

- do a search on the Internet for similar ideas
- do a paper sketch of the project to help in later design, of what you intend to fabricate
- list down the items/tasks that you have to perform
- run the design idea by your lecturer to finalize the scope of what you need to do.
- plan the time allocation for each of the sections.

## Step 1

When you select and finalize your project, please take note of

- what you intend your project to do, what are its limitations
- who your project is intended for (the users)
- who has done your project before and why it is different


### Outcomes

The outcomes of your initial design are
- sketches and thoughts on the idea for the project
- initial desings in CAD for parts to be lasercut and 3D printed.
- the choice of microcontroller and input and output devices.
- any previous references to similar projects.


## Step 2

Prepare your project for fabrication.

Before you start fabricating your project, you should consider writing out a Bill-Of-Materials (BOM).  The BOM shows the components needed for the project.

You are allowed to use other components/modules for the project. please consult your lecturer regarding availability.  For example, you might require a Real-time clock module for the Arduino to keep track of the time.  Your lecturer may need to order the item in for you and it usually takes 2-3 weeks before the module is delivered. The BOM will show what you require and whether it is in stock.  It helps you plan the development of the project.  Please don't ask for "fantastic" modules e.g. GPS or Gas-sensors, these are expensive and we most probably do not have them in stock, however, you are free to acquire them at your own expense.

### Outcomes

At this stage, you should be able to submit the following documents as evidence of your work:
1. The Bill-of-materials
2. CAD drawings of items to be fabricated
3. Physical parts which have been lasercut and/or 3D printed


## Step 3

Include an embedded system with the necessary input and output devices to add
functionality to your project.  Start with the microcontroller board and begin to test out single components to ensure that they work properly.  You might want to include snippets of code to check the interfacing and working of difference  sections.

At this stage you should start combining your module project components (chasis, parts, input and output devices).  Try fitting them and make small changes to adapt them to the design.

### Outcomes

You should put aside at lease a week or two to complete the electronics and microcontroller testing of the project.  You should be able to show
1.  A semi-assembled system
2.  Demonstrate that your microcontroller works with different components.
3.  Begin the final assembly and interfacing


## Step 4

This is the final stage of the project.  You should set aside time to complete your documentation/blog, the addition of power switches and DC supplies, the creation of your presentation slide and a 1 minute video.

Do not wait until the last moment to complete this section as this section carries a high component of the marks allocated.

### Outcomes

You should be completing your project.  Do not worry if it is not 100% complete or if it does not work properly.  You will need to complete the following outcomes in order to score and pass this module:
1.  Complete your documentation on your blog/web site
2.  Prepare your presentation slide (1920x1080 pixels) as per the instructions.
3.  Prepare a 1 minute video to demonstrate your product


## Step 5

You will be asked to reserve a 15 minute slot for your presentation and demonstration of your module project.

A schedule will be presented to you for registration.  Please reserve your presentation slot and include your presentation slide and video URLs as well.

You need not prepare a formal presentation, the single presentation slide should suffice, together with your project video.  Your lecturer will grade you on the work you have done.

## Submission

The submission of the final project will include (located on your github folder)

1. The documentation of the project, housed in github together with your module journey.  The documentation must contain the following sections:
  - A preliminary project sketch
  - the project design (where it came from, who has done what before, what changes you have made)
  - a detailed "how-to" in the construction of the project
  - original design files and code.
  - photos, images of your project journey
  - BOM (Bill of materials)
  - what was completed, what was successful, what needs more work
  - the user manual
2. A presentation of the project, which includes
  - A formal presentation
  - A demonstration of the project
  - A single page "cover sheet" of the project
    - saved as <id>_presentation.png
    - resolution of 1920x1080
    - describes the project, creator, features
  - A one-minute video of the project
5. The completed project

The submission date of your project (online) is **Wednesday, 12noon, 12th August 2020**.  All late submissions will be penalized.

The project presentations will be held from Mon 17th August to Friday 21st August 2020.  You will be informed of the schedule at a later date.

### Project plan

We would like to suggest the following project plan towards the completion of your project.

| Target Date | Duration  | Tasks to be completed  |
|:-----------:|:---------:|------------------------------------------------------|
|Lesson 1A      | 4 hr      | Selection of project, internet searches, project scope    |
|                 | 2 hr      | Project sketch, bill of materials |
|Lesson 1B      | 4 hr      | Clear idea, requirements, scope through your lecturer, finalize intentions |
|Lesson 2A      | 8 hr      | CAD designs, 2D layouts, 3D designs, preliminary embedded design |
|Lesson 2B      | 8 hr      | Laser cut, 3D printed, prototype mock up |
|                 | 4 hr      | Embedded design, I/O considerations, testing |
|Lesson 3A       | 12 hr     | Finishing touches, testing

Note that there is no time(s) allocated for the documentation.  You **MUST** document as you go, otherwise you will not be able to complete the tasks as well as write the documentation at the same time.


### Project Suggestions

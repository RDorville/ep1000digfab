# Output Devices

[Presentation: Output Devices](ep1000_actuators.pdf)

Output devices are often called **Actuators**.  An Actuator is a component that moves or controls movement.  We use output devices to display information or move mechanisms.

## Actuators

We use computer processors to control actuators so that we can obtain output (display, movement, motion) precisely.  This is a very efficient as we can get precise control over the devices.

We can also use computer processors to control the amount of energy supplied giving rise to control of speed or motion.

Output devices are usually
- Displays
  - LED displays
  - LCD displays
  - Other light devices
- Motors
  - DC motors, requiring speed control
  - Servo motors
  - Stepper motors
- Control of high-powered devices
  - Transistor drivers
  - Relays


## Methods of control

Output devices are usually slower to react than the signals sent by the computer processor, hence we usually need to insert a delay for the reaction time.

Example: LED blinking

If we were to have the following code

```c++
while (true){}
    digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(LED, LOW);
}
```

We will not be able to see the changes happening as our eyes only respond to changes greater than 1/30 second.  Hence, we would see that the LED is always lit up (known as Persistence of Vision)

These are the common methods of control for output devices
-  continually send output information
-  use a timer to send data, based on a preset delay
-  query, wait for a signal from the output device before sending new data.

&nbsp;

## Output devices with the Arduino

### LED displays

[Single LED](https://components101.com/diodes/5mm-round-led)
- referenced by the diameter of the LED e,g, 3mm. 5mm, 10mm
- use digitalWrite() to send HIGH/LOW
- use a current limiting resistor
- use a delay to see the results

[RGB LED](https://components101.com/rgb-led-pinout-configuration-circuit-datasheet)
- similar to a single LED except that you have 3 LEDs fused into the housing (requires a current limiting resistor for EACH of the R, G, B)
- either common cathode (connect to GND) or common anode (connect to Vcc)
- placing a signal on each of the R, G, B pins lights up the respective color of the LED
- in order to get different hues, shades use PWM (analogWrite()) to change the average voltage of each color pin.
- Ref: Arduino Project Hub [Arduino RGB LED Tutorial](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/muhammad-aqib/arduino-rgb-led-tutorial-fc003e)

```c++
    // assume that HIGH powers up the LED
    // to get RED
    digitalWrite(RED, HIGH);

    // to get Yellow, turn ON the RED and GREEN LEDs
    digitalWrite(RED, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(GREEN, HIGH);

    // to get shades
    RGB_lightup(127, 0, 0);         // mid-Red
    RGB_lightup(255,255,0);         // bright Yellow
    ...

// function to get different colors from an RGB using analogWrite()
void RGB_lightup(int red, int green, int blue){
    analogWrite(RED, red);
    analogWrite(GREEN, green);
    analogWrite(BLUE, blue);
}
```

### Other displays

[NeoPixel LEDs](https://components101.com/displays/neopixel-led-strip)
-   These are LED strips of serially interconnected RGB LEDs that are individually addressable and programmable.
-   Programming is done through a single serial data line which sends the address and light-up information of a particular LED on the strip.
-   Neopixel LEDs are good for configurable lighting, where you can change the intensity (number of LEDs lighted) as well as the color.
-   Neopixel LEDs require quite a lot of current, so don't expect to light up more than 8 using the USB supply!
-   Adafruit provides an excellent [NeoPixel Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/arduino-library-use) and library.

## [DC Motors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_motor)

Motors play an important role in the movement of mechanisms and objects.

There are many types of motors, classified simply as follows:
- AC motors using alternating current power
- [DC motors](https://www.elprocus.com/dc-motor-basics-types-application/) using direct current power
  - series DC motors
    - typical DC motor e.g. used in Tamiya cars
    - controlled using voltage
    - typically H-bridge controller using PWM
  - servo motors
    - two types
      - continuous rotation (control direction and stop)
      - positional (control angle)
    - control is done with PWM
  - stepper motors
    - can control movement of motor one-step at a time
    - usually with a motor controller
    - motion is turning ON/OFF coils in the motor
  - geared DC motors
    - motors with an internal gearing system
    - creates higher torque or faster rotations
    - applies to all types of motors

### DC motors

- Rotational speed is proportional to the applied voltage.
- If we can control/change the voltage we can change the speed.
- Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) provides a means for control
- Most motors draw a lot of current
  - cannot be supplied by the GPIO pin of a computer processor
  - control methods - Ref: [Tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/arduino/arduino_dc_motor.htm)
    - use a relay
      - Ref: [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Relay-switch-motor-controller-Arduino/)
      - processor controls relay input
      - relay allows the switching of higher currents
      - usually for direction of rotation, not speed
    - use a NPN transistor/MOSFET to supply the current.
      - Ref:
        - Transistor NPN - [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/id/12V-Motor-Control-With-5V-Arduino-and-NPN-Transist/)
        - MOSFET - [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/id/ArduinoMicrocontroller-MOSFET/)
      - processor controls the transistor
      - transistor acts as a switch (Ref: Ermicoblog [Using Transistor as a Switch](http://www.ermicro.com/blog/?p=423))
      - transistor is able to drive the current
      - using PWM we can control the speed of the motor

    ![Motor control with NPN](images/1503_npnmotor.png "Motor control with NPN")

    - use a H-bridge (L298N) 
      - Ref:
        -  [Dronebot Workshop](https://dronebotworkshop.com/dc-motors-l298n-h-bridge/)
        -  [LastMinuteEngineers](https://lastminuteengineers.com/l298n-dc-stepper-driver-arduino-tutorial/)
      - allows control of direction as well as speed
      - standard method of control of DC motors
      - H-bridge (L298N) and DC motor available upon request
      - usual configuration for Robots, moving vehicles<br>

### Servo Motors

- Ref:
  - LastMinuteEngieers: [How Servo Motors work * Interface it with Arduino](https://lastminuteengineers.com/servo-motor-arduino-tutorial/)
  - DroneBot Workshop: [Using Servo Motors with the Arduino](https://dronebotworkshop.com/servo-motors-with-arduino/)
- You may need to provide extra electrical current from an external source to the servo motor.
- Has an internal control circuit with geared motors
  - controlled using pulses (PWM)
  - pulses determine
    - position of the servo motor, or
    - direction of rotation of the servo motor
- Two types of servo motor
  - [Positional (e.g FS90)](https://www.pololu.com/product/2818)
  - [Continuous Rotational (e.g. FS90R)](https://www.pololu.com/product/2820)
- Positional Servo (FS90)
  - Works at 3.0~5.0V with 120 degree angle
  - Servo pulses between 900 uS to 2100 uS determines position
  - Used for maintaining control position e.g. drones, RC planes
- Continuous Rotation (FS90R)
  - Works at 3.0~5.0V with 360 degree rotation
  - Servo pulses control direction of rotation or stoppage
  - Used for moving robots, small vehicles with movement control
- Simple calibration circuit
  - Uses potentiometer to read in analog value
  - Controls with pulse width by mapping analog value (0-1023) to percentage (0-255)

### Stepper Motors

Ref:
- DroneBot Workshop [Stepper Motors with Arduino](https://dronebotworkshop.com/stepper-motors-with-arduino/)
- LastMinuteEngineers [Control 28BYJ-48 Stepper Motor with ULN2003 Driver & Arduino](https://lastminuteengineers.com/28byj48-stepper-motor-arduino-tutorial/)

A stepper motor is a motor that is able to move in "steps".  Each step is a division (in degrees) of the full rotational movement done by activating the motor coils, in turn. [Ref: Wikipedia Stepper Motor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepper_motor)

Stepper motors are great for
- exact positional control
- moving forward/backward at specific speeds
- used in robots, CNC machines (e.g. 3D printers, Laser cutters)

Stepper motors for applications and commercial use
- Most commercial-grade stepper motors are bipolar motors (e.g. [NEMA 17](https://components101.com/motors/nema17-stepper-motor))
- Most commercial applications use hardware control boards (e.g. Pololu [A4988 Stepper Motor controller](https://www.pololu.com/product/1182))
- Control is done by the A4988 board, with the application supplying pulses for each step and directional control only
- Arduino A4988 Control References: LastMinuteEngineers [Control Stepper Motor with A4988 Driver Module & Arduino](https://lastminuteengineers.com/a4988-stepper-motor-driver-arduino-tutorial/)
- Understanding Stepper Motor control
  - [28BYJ-48 Unipolar stepper motor](https://components101.com/motors/28byj-48-stepper-motor)
    - this is a geared motor
    - provides a full-step of 11.25 degrees, however with the gear reduction there are approximately 2038 steps.
    - consumes about 240 mA, even when not in motion, so it would be best to have an external supply
  - ULN2003 motor control board
    - uses transistors to drive the stepper motor
    - provides an external power supply, separate from the Arduino
    - has drives for each of the coils of the stepper motor

  ![28BYJ-48 Stepper Motor and ULN2003 Driver](images/1505_28byj.png "28BYJ-48 Stepper Motor and ULN2003 Driver")

Ref: [LastMinuteEngineers](https://lastminuteengineers.com/28byj48-stepper-motor-arduino-tutorial/)

 - 28BYJ library is provided (Ref: [Arduino 28BYJ Stepper Motor Library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/reference/stepper))
 - Easy to drive the motor using the step-waveform table

  ![28BYJ Stepping Methods](images/1506_28byjstep.jpg "28BYJ Stepping Methods")

Ref: [Step Motor 28BYJ-48 Spec sheet](http://newsphonereview.xyz/step-motor-28byj-48-spec-sheet/)]

  &nbsp;

  ![28BYJ Wiring Diagram](images/1507_28byjwiring.jpg "28BYJ Wiring Diagram")

You can move the motor using the following sequence:
1.  define an array holding the step sequences e.g. Full Step sequence { 1100, 0110, 0011, 1011, etc}
2.  Loop
    - output 1st value in array
    - have a small delay (this determines the speed of rotation)
    - increment the next step
    - if you come to the end of the array, start over

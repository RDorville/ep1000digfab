    <h1>Welcome to my first web page!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.  It is just some text written without regard
    to the use of whitespace, as HTML ignores spaces, tabs and newlines.</p>
    <p>Sometimes we would want to have un-ordered lists of items, also known as,
    bullet points.  Some of the list items are links to other sites..</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Web Servers and hosting services</li>
        <li><a href="atom.io">Atom Text Editor</a></li>
        <li><a href="www.google.com">Google Search</a></li>
    </ul>

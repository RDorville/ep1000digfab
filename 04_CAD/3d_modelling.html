# 3D Modelling Techniques

[Presentation: 3D Model Part 2 - Revolve, Sculpt](ep1000_3dmodel2.pdf)

## Recap of Fusion 360

By now, you should be familiar with the following in Fusion 360

[![Fusion360_interface](images/0601_f260interface.jpg)](images/0601_f260interface.jpg)

[Fusion 360 interface](https://productdesignonline.com/fusion-360-tutorials/learn-the-fusion-360-user-interface/)

1. Application Bar
2. Data Panel
  - Houses all your design files, Allows creation of new preojects.
3. Profile & Help
  - Allows settings of Preferences
  - Ensure that you have the Z-axis pointing up
  - All measurements to be done in mm
4. Toolbar
  - Essential command set in each area that you are working on
5. Browser
  - Lists objects in your design
  - Creation of object: Object - Component - Sketch
  - Controls visibility
6. ViewCube
  - Home view
  - Orientation of object
7. Canvas & Marking menu
8. Navigation Bar & Display Settings
9. Timeline
  - Shows order of operations
  - Allows editing and manipulation of features

### Workflow

In the creation of any new design, a good workflow plan would be:

1.  Sketch, on paper, how your overall design would look like
  - decide on profiles
  - 2D and 3D layouts
2.  Obtain any dimensions that you may need to draw your object accurately
  - Measure and estimate
  - Obtain a canvas, to map the drawing
3.  Create the object
  - Create the component, components help to break down the object
  - Create sketch of the profile of the object
  - From sketch, create a 3D model
4.  Inpect and make corrections, adjustments.


### Tips & Tricks

* [Origin, workplanes](https://youtu.be/Nlvy3rPCRwA) Start your sketch from the origin, it anchors the rest of your sketch to a specific point.  Start watching at 6:00 (he rambles on a lot!)
* [Constraints](https://youtu.be/_MpL9fPAUG4) - fix your sketchs so that they don't change accidentally
* [5 tips for getting started](https://youtu.be/ezKZIvzVGRM) - gets you started the proper way



## Creating 3D Models

There are 4 basic methods of creating a 3D Model:

### Extrusion

Extrusion is the easiest method of creating a 3D model
- Create a 2D closed profile in one of the planes (e.g. XY)
- Extrude the profile in the third axis (e.g. Z)

3-types of extrusion are provided:
- New Body - creates a new body
- Join - joins extruded body with the existing body
- Cut - uses the extrusion to remove unwanted parts

Can use Extrude or Press-Pull in Fusion 360
- Desktop Makes: [Press Pull vs Extrusion in Fusion 360](https://youtu.be/elQ648fVpwA)

Only good if you have a profile(s) to work with.

### Revolution

[3D Objects using Revolution](worksheets/3D_Objects_using_Revolution.pdf)

Creates a 3D model based on a profile and an axis to revolve upon.
- Draw a 2D closed profile on one of the planes (e.g. XY)
- Revolve the object about the third axis (e.g. Z)
- Revolution can be
  - Partial, based on angle, or limits
  - Full 360
- Lars Christensen: [How to Model Anything Round](https://youtu.be/zYMf6qncgwc)

- Good for creating globes, sectors, cylinders, profiles.

### Lofting

Create closed profiles in the plane outlining your shape

Need to understand - Planes and Offset planes

Use loft to create the 3D object by extrapolating the outlines from one profile to another.  The extrapolation can be
- regular, formed from the contours of the profiles
  - Mufasa CAD [Fusion 360 How To Loft Object, Point And Rails](https://youtu.be/-Z9ioh2NfwY)
- center-line rail, formed by a line/arc perpendicular to the profiles
  - [Example from AutoDesk](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/fusion-360-design-validate/introduction-to-loft-using-rail-curves-in-fusion/td-p/7296238)
- Good for creating ducts, continous 3D models

|Create the profiles on different planes|Loft > Select the profiles| Results|


### Sculpting

Creating an object using a basic 3D shape, breaking up the shape into sections and then manipulating the shape to what you want.

Like playing with plastercine, ideal for the creative-minded.

Good tutorials on sculpting
- Product Design Online: [How to Sculpt an Earbud in Fusion 360](https://youtu.be/dbJcnxWHneo)
- Product Design Online: Sculpting for Plastic Parts in Fusion 360
    - [Part 1](https://youtu.be/Vrg6h5h_vWs)
    - [Part 2](https://youtu.be/FIbmiTTEo_8)

Good for creating objects without fixed profiles or need to be shaped
- Can be very time-consuming
- Has great effects

## Safety Issues

FabLab @ Singapore Polytechnic has a large number of tools, equipment and machinery which you can use to fabricate your project.  In the course of the module, you will be taught the operation of some of these tools and equipment, however before that, we need to ensure your safety in the lab.

The **Safety Assessment** is mandatory for all users of FabLab@SP.  The documentation and notes for the course is common throughout all courses and is available on the [E-learning Site at SP](https://esp.sp.edu.sg).  You are encouraged to go through the material before taking the Safety Assessment.

To access the Safety information on the SP E-learning site:

1.  Open your browser to [E-learning Site at SP](https://esp.sp.edu.sg)
2.  Select **My Community** from the top Ribbon bar
3.  Click on  **FABLAB@SP**
4.  Select **Fab Lab Safety Program** on the left hand menu


## Safety Assessment

We require that the Safety Assessment be done physically at the lab, and as such will be conducted at the start of the next laboratory session.This will be the first task you undertake upon entering the lab.

You need to score at least 80% before you can pass this assessment.  This score will be added to your overall marks for this module.

## Fablab Management System (FLMS)

The [FablabSP Management System (FLMS)](https://flms.sp.edu.sg) is used to manage the resources of FablabSP.  This system allows FablabSP to manage the equipment, courses, users, materials and skills offered.  As a user, FLMS allows you to book and use equipment in the Fablab.  However, before you can start using the equipment, you must first register as a member and show you competency in skills.  You can increase your skills by taking courses from the Fablab.  The system will track your progress and allow usage when you are proved competent.

We will require you to register as a member on the FLMS.  Registration and use is free to all full-time students and staff of Singapore Polytechnic.  Please self-register using your ichat email login.
